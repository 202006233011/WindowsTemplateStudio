# Navigation pane project type

This project includes a Hamburger Menu from [MahApps.Metro](../mahapps-metro.md) nuget package at the side of the screen, for navigation between pages.

This style is popular in mobile apps but also works well on larger screens. The menu can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on the hamburger button.

The menu shows items with an icon and text. The menu can show the icon, or show the icon and text.

Navigation pane projects use [MahApps.Metro](../mahapps-metro.md) to add modern styles to the user interface.
